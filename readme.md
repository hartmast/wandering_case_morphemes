# Wandering case morphemes

This repository contains data for a corpus study on non-canonical uses of the German adpositions *um...willen* and *wegen*. In these non-canonical uses, they occur with a genitive-*s*, e.g. *um des Frieden willen**s*** or *des Frieden wegen**s***. Borrowing a term from Eisenberg (2013) - who in turn has borrowed the metaphor from Fourquet (1973) - I call these items "wandering case morphemes". See the correspinding [OSF repository](https://osf.io/aumg2/) for data and more information.
